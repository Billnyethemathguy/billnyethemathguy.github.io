  <p> The first step you must take is to position yourself in the center of the goalposts, relative to the player who is shooting.
    It should be noted that you be standing atleast twelve inches ahead of the posts to increase the possibiliy of saving the ball.
  <li> Dive towards the direction of the ball, if it is moving towards your direction, stay in place. </li>
  <p> When diving it is important to take a stong step towards the direction of the ball for more momentum. Arms should
     also not be outwide before the step is taken to further increase your momentum. </p>
  <li> If the ball is going towards you, create a V-shape with your hands or roll the ball to your chest using your arms in a bicep curling position if not reach your arms out towards to ball </li>
IF the ball comes to the center, that's good. ceate a V-shape with your hands to catch the ball with your hands or roll the ball to your chest using your arms for a comfortable catch.
  <li> Keep your eyes on the ball and make small adjustments based on the direction of the ball </li>
  <li> Stay focused and catch the ball </li>
